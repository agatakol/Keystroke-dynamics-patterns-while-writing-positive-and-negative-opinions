# Keystroke dynamics patterns while writing positive and negative opinions

The repository contains data collected in 2017 in order to perform an experiment in which keystroke dynamics patterns were analyzed while writing various opinions. The participants were asked to write opinions on their worst and best learning experience, while all keystrokes were captured. The research question of the study might be given as follows: Is there any difference in keystroke dynamics patterns while writing positive and negative opinions.

The **data.csv** file contains feature vectors extracted on the basis of raw data. There are 245 vectors containing 51 features (columns). For each of 49 participants 5 feature vectors were extracted (5 x 49 = 245):  
1 - vector extracted on the basis of all keestrokes generated by a user during the experiment session  
2 - vector extracted on te basis of keystrokes generated by a user while writing an opinion on the best teacher  
3 - vector extracted on te basis of keystrokes generated by a user while writing an opinion on the worst teacher  
4 - vector extracted on te basis of keystrokes generated by a user while writing an opinion on the best subject  
5 - vector extracted on te basis of keystrokes generated by a user while writing an opinion on the worst teacher  



The columns headers indicate the type of feature. They are defined as follows:





The **labels.csv** file contains PAD (Pleasure, Arousal, Dominace) labels reported at specified moments of the experiment session.
